Python == 3.10.11
Installing dependencies from root:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Remember, python can be much nicer with just a simple `python -m venv venv`

React:
typescript
only typescript

Running electron
go to frontend directory
`npm run dev`

Database:
We will just use a live dev database. Can't be bothered working out a consistent way to get databases up on running on machines.
If you need the database info, just reach out to me.

You will want to use mprocs.
